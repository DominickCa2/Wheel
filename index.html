    <h2 id="tribute-info">Steering wheels are pretty great</h2>
    <p>Steering wheels have been around for billions if not millions of minutes, and they can look like the one on this pirate ship or the one in your car, but they are always round (otherwise it wouldn't be a wheel). </p>
    <p>Now, some people probably think that they can make something better than a steering wheel. Take Tesla for example. They tried making something called a yoke. It works well until you have to get through the McDonald's drive thru. </p>

    <p>Steering wheels usually allow you to turn the wheel around more than once. This gives you more torque on the wheel and it also lets you do more mini-adjustments while you're driving.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: Steering wheels are cool. They give you more torque over the steering and let you make small adjustments. So why not give everything a steering wheel?</p>
